Selenium Tests for flies

* Note: This README assumes you have at least basic knowledge of selenium,
        such as using Selenium IDE to edit, load, save test cases and test suites.
        Selenium server and browsers such as firefox and/or google-chrome should also be installed.

0. Glossaries:
   * Test Case: A list of selenium commands (selenese) that perform a certain action.
                e.g. Login, Logout, go to Japanese translation...
   * Test Suite: A list of test cases for performing a certain task.
   * Test Root: The directory that contains all the tests.
                By default, it is at the subdirectory "resources".

1. File naming convention.
   Test case and suite files should be named according to file naming convention,
   otherwise those test files won't be picked up by test system.
   * Test Case: A .html file that start with an English alphabet.
   * Test Suite: A .html file with the prefix "0-". 
     The middle name will be use as test name. 
     For example, name the suite "0-Tribe_JoinLeave.html",
     if the test name "Tribe_JoinLeave" is desired.

  It's recommended that a test suite and its corresponding test cases
  occupy their own directory. This directory should be under the test root.


2. How to make a test suite:
   In flies, test suites are unit of testing.
   Following steps show how to make a test case.

   Step 1: Make a test suite and corresponding test suite in selenium IDE.
           Note that: test suites does not need to include login/logout functions,
                      because test system will add the them automatically.

   Step 2: Run "cmake ."
           This will pick up all the test suites and make corresponding make rules.

3. Running test:
   Run "make test"
