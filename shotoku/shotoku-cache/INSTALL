Installation of Shotoku Renewable Cache
---------------------------------------

First, you need to download and unpack JBoss AS 4.0.x (http://labs.jboss.com/jbossas) and
JBoss Cache 1.4.x (http://labs.jboss.com/jbosscache) (to install JBoss Cache, you just need
to copy two files: lib/jboss-cache.jar and lib/jgroups.jar from the distribution package to
${jboss.home}/server/${conf}/lib).

${conf} is the name of the application server configuration you use - most commonly it is
"default".

Then, you have to:
1. copy shotoku-cache.jar to ${jboss.home}/server/${conf}/lib
2. copy shotoku-cache-service.sar to ${jboss.home}/server/${conf}/deploy
3. copy shotoku-cache-admin.war (optional) to ${jboss.home}/server/${conf}/deploy

To configure the cache and the underlying tree cache, see the file shotoku-cache-service.sar/META-INF/jboss-service.xml.

You can then start the AS. To see the administration panel, go to:
http://localhost:8080/shotoku-cache-admin
